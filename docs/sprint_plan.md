Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal
Implement core trading functionality with mock data and enhance user experience for new users.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks (7 items)

### High Priority
1. Implement mock data service (8 story points)
   - Create mock data for all API endpoints
   - Ensure mock data is visible on all pages
   - Implement toggle between mock and real data

2. Develop user onboarding flow (5 story points)
   - Create step-by-step guide for new users
   - Implement interactive tooltips for key features
   - Add a demo account option for new users

3. Implement basic charting tools (13 story points)
   - Integrate a charting library (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js)
   - Add basic chart types and indicators

### Medium Priority
4. Enhance risk management features (8 story points)
   - Add stop-loss and take-profit functionality
   - Implement basic risk calculator tool

5. Implement real-time updates for key data (13 story points)
   - Set up WebSocket connection for live data
   - Update UI components in real-time for currency pairs and positions

### Low Priority
6. Improve error handling (3 story points)
   - Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
   - Add user-friendly error messages

7. Optimize performance (5 story points)
   - Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Use React.memo for performance-critical components

## Dependencies and Risks

- The mock data service (item 1) is a prerequisite for all other tasks, as it provides the necessary data for testing and development.
- Real-time updates (item 5) depend on the availability of a WebSocket API or similar technology.
- Charting tools (item 3) may require additional time for team members to learn the chosen library.
- Risk: Integration of the charting library may introduce performance issues that need to be addressed.

## Definition of Done

For this sprint, a task is considered done when:

1. The feature is implemented according to the specifications.
2. Unit tests are written and passing for new code.
3. The feature is tested on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. Code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
5. The feature is deployed to the staging environment without errors.
6. Documentation (inline comments and README) is updated to reflect the new feature.
7. The product owner has reviewed and accepted the feature.
8. Any known bugs or issues are documented in the issue tracker.

## Additional Notes

- Total story points for the sprint: 55
- Team capacity should be considered when committing to this sprint plan
- Daily stand-ups will be used to track progress and identify any blockers
- A sprint review and retrospective will be held at the end of the sprint to evaluate progress and gather feedback
```

This sprint plan focuses on implementing core functionality with mock data, enhancing the user experience for new users, and setting up the foundation for real-time trading features. The selected items balance high-priority tasks with some medium and low-priority improvements to create a well-rounded sprint.
