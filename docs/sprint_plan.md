Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Fix critical bugs, implement mock data service, and improve error handling to
establish a stable foundation for further development.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority

1. Fix "news.map is not a function" TypeError (3 story points)
2. Fix empty market news issue (2 story points)
3. Implement mock data service (8 story points)
    - Create mock data for all API endpoints
    - Ensure mock data is visible on all pages
    - Implement toggle between mock and real data
4. Implement error boundaries for each major component (5 story points)
5. Create user-friendly error messages (3 story points)

### Medium Priority

6. Implement lazy loading for components (5 story points)
7. Use React.memo and useMemo for performance-critical components (3 story
   points)

## Effort Estimates

Total Story Points: 29

## Dependencies and Risks

-   The mock data service implementation (Task 3) is a prerequisite for properly
    testing and fixing the news-related bugs (Tasks 1 and 2).
-   Implementing error boundaries (Task 4) may reveal additional issues that
    need to be addressed.
-   Performance optimizations (Tasks 6 and 7) may introduce unexpected behavior
    and require thorough testing.

## Definition of Done

-   All selected tasks are completed and tested.
-   Code has been reviewed and merged into the main branch.
-   All new features and fixes are documented.
-   The application runs without critical errors using mock data.
-   Performance improvements are measurable and documented.
-   Unit tests are written for new components and functions.
-   The application passes all existing automated tests.
-   The product owner has reviewed and approved the implemented features.
```

This sprint plan focuses on addressing the critical bugs and implementing the
mock data service, which are essential for stabilizing the application and
enabling further development. It also includes some performance optimizations to
improve the overall user experience. The plan takes into account the
dependencies between tasks and potential risks associated with the
implementation.
