## Design Considerations

-   Implement a responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
-   Use a modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability
-   Implement lazy loading for improved performance
-   Utilize custom hooks for reusable logic
-   Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
-   Use React Suspense for code-splitting and improved loading states
-   Optimize for SEO with React Helmet
-   Use React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization
-   Implement progressive web app (PWA) features
-   Utilize React Context API for global state management
-   Implement React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
-   Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
-   Use React Spring for smooth animations and transitions
-   Implement a shared state management solution (e.g., Redux or Recoil) for
    complex state management
-   Utilize CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or Emotion for better
    component styling
-   Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
-   Implement a design system for consistent UI/UX across the application
-   Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
-   Implement data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js) for
    advanced charting
-   Implement a feature flag system for gradual rollout of new features

## Performance Optimization

-   Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for improved initial load times
-   Use IndexedDB for client-side caching of large datasets
-   Implement virtual scrolling for long lists of trades or market data
-   Use Web Workers for offloading heavy computations
-   Implement code-splitting at the route level for faster page loads
-   Use service workers for offline functionality and faster subsequent loads
-   Implement image lazy loading and optimization techniques
-   Use CDN for static assets delivery

## Analytics and Monitoring

-   Implement error tracking and logging (e.g., Sentry)
-   Add user behavior analytics for UX improvements
-   Implement performance monitoring and real-time alerting
-   Create a dashboard for key performance indicators (KPIs)

# TODO

-   add privacy and terms pages
